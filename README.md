## Project

This project was developed using SwiftUI.

To start, I used a struct with all the rules to calculate the final result.

So in the View I used Navigation View with Form. 

Inside Form, I added a section that contains text field and picker to the user select number of people. In the second section there are a header: Text and a picker to select the amount of the tip, I used 20% default, but the user can change it. The last section there is text that show the amount that each person will pay.

At the top of the screen there is a navigationBarTitle.

**Learning about: SwiftUI, Xcode, View, NavigationView, Form, Section, TextField, Picker, ForEach, and more.**

*This project was developed during Hacking with SwiftUI course.*
